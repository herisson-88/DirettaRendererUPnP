# Changelog

## 2026-01-22 (Session 11) - Timestamped Logging

### Human-Readable Timestamps

Added timestamped logging with real clock time format `[HH:MM:SS.mmm]` for easier log analysis.

**Before:**
```
[AudioDecoder] PCM: flac 192000Hz/24bit/2ch
[Callback] Sending 8192 samples
```

**After:**
```
[14:01:17.662] [AudioDecoder] PCM: flac 192000Hz/24bit/2ch
[14:01:17.667] [Callback] Sending 8192 samples
```

**Implementation:**
- New `TimestampedStreambuf` class intercepts all `std::cout`/`std::cerr` output
- Automatically prepends timestamp at the start of each line
- Uses system clock with millisecond precision
- Installed at the very beginning of `main()` before any other code

**Files Added:**
- `src/TimestampedLogger.h` - Timestamp streambuf implementation

**Files Changed:**
- `src/main.cpp` - Include and install timestamped logging

**Benefit:** Logs now show actual wall-clock time, making it easy to correlate events and measure timing gaps (useful for diagnosing stuttering issues).

## 2026-01-21 (Session 10) - High Sample Rate Fix & Install Script Improvements

### High Sample Rate Stuttering Fix

**Problem:** Users reported stuttering and clicking when playing files above 96kHz (192kHz, 352.8kHz, 384kHz). The issue occurred because `bytesPerBuffer` was limited to MTU size but the SDK cycle time was calculated for 1ms buffers, creating a ~4% data deficit.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- At 192kHz/32-bit/stereo: 1ms = 1536 bytes (exceeds MTU 1500)
- Previous fix limited buffer to 1472 bytes but cycle time expected 1536 bytes
- Result: Target consumed data faster than we supplied it

**Solution:** Synchronized `bytesPerBuffer` with `DirettaCycleCalculator`:
- **Low sample rates (≤96kHz):** Use 1ms buffers with drift correction for 44.1kHz family
- **High sample rates (>96kHz):** Use MTU-sized buffers matching the cycle time calculation

**Files Changed:**
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp:configureRingPCM()` - New buffer sizing logic based on sample rate
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp:configureRingDSD()` - Same logic applied to DSD

### Installation Script Improvements

**Merged `install.sh` and `systemd/install-systemd.sh`** into a single unified installer.

**New Menu Options:**
```
1) Full installation (recommended)
   - Dependencies, FFmpeg, build, systemd service

2) Install dependencies only
   - Base packages and FFmpeg

3) Build only
   - Compile the renderer (assumes dependencies installed)

4) Install systemd service only
   - Install renderer as system service (assumes built)

5) Configure network only
   - Network interface and firewall setup

6) Aggressive Fedora optimization (Fedora only)
   - For dedicated audio servers only

q) Quit
```

**New Command-Line Options:**
- `--service, -s` - Install systemd service only
- `--network, -n` - Configure network only

**Enhanced `setup_systemd_service()` Function:**
- Copies binary to `/opt/diretta-renderer-upnp/`
- Installs wrapper script `start-renderer.sh`
- Creates configuration file `diretta-renderer.conf`
- Uses files from `systemd/` directory if available
- Creates default files if not found

**Files Changed:**
- `install.sh` - Complete menu restructure and systemd integration

## 2026-01-20 (Session 9) - SDK 148 API Clarification

### Yu Harada's Response

Contacted Yu Harada regarding SDK 148 migration. His response clarified the expected usage:

> "Sync::getNewStream has changed its arguments. This is the base struct for Stream in the previous version. If a segment fault occurs, there is a problem with how memory is managed."

### Interpretation

SDK 148's `getNewStream(diretta_stream&)` API requires **application-managed memory**:
- The application must allocate its own buffer
- Assign buffer pointer to `diretta_stream.Data.P`
- Set buffer size in `diretta_stream.Size`

This is the **correct usage pattern**, not a workaround. The `DIRETTA::Stream` class methods are not intended for use with SDK 148's `getNewStream()`.

### Updated Documentation

Comments in code updated to reflect this is the expected API usage, not a bug workaround.

---

## 2026-01-19 (Session 8) - SDK 148 Track Change Fix

### Problem

SDK 148 introduces API changes requiring application-managed memory for `getNewStream()`. Initial implementation incorrectly used `DIRETTA::Stream` class methods, causing segmentation faults during track changes.

**SDK 148 API Changes:**
1. `getNewStream()` signature changed from `Stream&` to `diretta_stream&` (pure virtual)
2. Stream copy semantics deleted (only move allowed)
3. Inheritance changed from `private diretta_stream` to `public diretta_stream`

### Solution

**Application-Managed Buffer (correct SDK 148 pattern):**
- Added persistent buffer `std::vector<uint8_t> m_streamData`
- Directly set `diretta_stream` C structure fields:
  ```cpp
  baseStream.Data.P = m_streamData.data();
  baseStream.Size = currentBytesPerBuffer;
  ```

This is the correct usage pattern for SDK 148 as confirmed by Yu Harada.

### Files Changed

- `src/DirettaSync.h` - Added `m_streamData` application-managed buffer
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp:getNewStream()` - Correct SDK 148 memory management
- `src/DirettaRenderer.cpp` - Removed `setForceFullReopen()` call

**Impact:** Reliable track skipping with SDK 148.

---

## 2026-01-19 - SDK 148 Critical Bug Fix: Double setSink Corruption (SUPERSEDED)

### Root Cause

**Bug:** `reopenForFormatChange()` called `setSink()` with old cached cycleTime, then caller called `setSink()` again with new format-specific cycleTime. SDK 148's internal stream objects became corrupted after this double initialization.

**Symptom:** Segfault in `DIRETTA::Stream::resize()` immediately after `reopenForFormatChange()` when worker thread first accesses streams.

**Fix:** Removed `setSink()` and `inquirySupportFormat()` from `reopenForFormatChange()`. The function now only does close/wait/open, letting the caller handle all configuration with proper parameters.

### Files Changed

- `src/DirettaSync.cpp:813-827` - Removed setSink()/inquirySupportFormat() from reopenForFormatChange()

---

## 2026-01-19 - SDK 148 Critical Bug Fix: Use-After-Free in reopenForFormatChange

### Root Cause

**Bug:** Worker thread continued running while SDK was closed, causing use-after-free segfault.

**Wrong ordering (caused crash):**
```cpp
DIRETTA::Sync::close();  // SDK freed
m_running = false;       // Worker still running, accesses freed memory!
m_workerThread.join();
```

**Fixed ordering:**
```cpp
m_running = false;       // Signal worker to stop
m_workerThread.join();   // Wait for worker to finish
DIRETTA::Sync::close();  // NOW safe to close SDK
```

### Impact

Fixes segmentation fault during:
- Track changes with format change (e.g., 44.1kHz → 48kHz)
- DSD → PCM transitions
- User-initiated track skip (EXPERIMENTAL: Force full reopen)

### Files Changed

- `src/DirettaSync.cpp:495-510` - DSD→PCM transition path
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp:550-565` - DSD rate change path
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp:787-804` - `reopenForFormatChange()`

---

## 2026-01-19 - SDK 148 Specific Optimizations

Optimizations leveraging new SDK 148 features.

### ~~Use `resize_noremap()` in Hot Path~~ (REVERTED)

**Attempted:** Use SDK 148's `resize_noremap()` to avoid reallocation.

**Result:** ❌ **REVERTED** - `resize_noremap()` crashes on freshly created Stream objects after `reopenForFormatChange()`. The internal vector is uninitialized and `_M_default_append()` segfaults.

**Workaround:** Continue using standard `resize()` which handles all cases safely.

**Future:** Investigate if `resize_noremap()` requires explicit initialization or is only safe for already-allocated streams.

---

### MSMODE Capability Logging

**Feature:** Log target's supported multi-stream modes (MS1/MS2/MS3) via SDK 148's `supportMSmode` field.

**File:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp:357-370`

**Benefit:** Visibility into target capabilities; warns if MS3 (our default) isn't supported.

---

## 2026-01-19 - Version 2.0-beta (Jitter Reduction Complete)

All critical jitter reduction optimizations from Phases 1 and 2 are now complete.

### G1: DSD Flow Control - 50× Jitter Reduction ⭐ CRITICAL

**Problem:** DSD retry loop used 5ms blocking sleep, causing ±2.5ms timing jitter. Linux scheduler quantum (1-4ms) makes 5ms sleep return anywhere from 5-9ms.

**Impact:** Severe jitter for high-resolution DSD playback (DSD512+).

**Solution:** Replace blocking sleep with condition variable-based flow control:
- Added `m_flowMutex` and `m_spaceAvailable` condition variable to DirettaSync
- Consumer (getNewStream) signals when buffer space available after pop
- Producer waits with 500µs timeout instead of 5ms blocking sleep
- Reduced max retries from 100 to 20 (total max wait: 10ms vs 500ms)

**Files:**
- `src/DirettaSync.h:392-423` - Flow control API
- `src/DirettaSync.h:483-487` - Flow control members
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp:1424-1430` - Signal after ring buffer pop
- `src/DirettaRenderer.cpp:263-284` - Event-based DSD send

**Before:**
```cpp
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(5));  // ±2.5ms jitter
```

**After:**
```cpp
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(m_direttaSync->getFlowMutex());
m_direttaSync->waitForSpace(lock, std::chrono::microseconds(500));  // ±50µs jitter
```

**Result:** Timing jitter reduced from ±2.5ms to ±50µs (50× improvement).

---

## 2026-01-19 - Correctness Fixes

Correctness fixes identified through expert analysis pass (EE + SE perspectives).

### G3: Non-Atomic Store Fix

**Problem:** Assignment to `std::atomic` variable without using atomic operation.

**Location:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp:1338`

**Before:**
```cpp
m_stabilizationCount = 0;  // Plain assignment - undefined behavior
```

**After:**
```cpp
m_stabilizationCount.store(0, std::memory_order_relaxed);
```

**Impact:** Fixes potential undefined behavior on ARM (Raspberry Pi) platforms.

**Bonus:** Also changed `fetch_add` from `acq_rel` to `relaxed` for this diagnostic counter (B1 optimization).

---

### G2: DSD Conversion Mode Race Condition Fix

**Problem:** `m_dsdConversionMode` was a plain enum accessed from multiple threads without synchronization.

**Location:** `src/DirettaSync.h:416`, `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (multiple locations)

**Before:**
```cpp
DirettaRingBuffer::DSDConversionMode m_dsdConversionMode{...};  // Plain enum
m_dsdConversionMode = mode;  // Plain assignment
```

**After:**
```cpp
std::atomic<DirettaRingBuffer::DSDConversionMode> m_dsdConversionMode{...};
m_dsdConversionMode.store(mode, std::memory_order_release);
// ... and .load() with appropriate ordering for reads
```

**Impact:** Eliminates potential race condition between producer (configureSinkDSD) and consumer (sendAudio) threads.

---

### G5: silenceByte_ Memory Ordering (Verified OK)

**Analysis:** Verified that existing implementation is already correct:
- Setter uses `memory_order_release`
- Getter uses `memory_order_acquire`
- Internal use in `fillWithSilence()` uses `relaxed` (acceptable - same thread)

**No changes required.**

---

### Version Bump

- Changed `RENDERER_VERSION` from `"1.2.0-simplified"` to `"2.0-beta"`
- **File:** `src/main.cpp:14`

---

### Documentation

- Added Phase 2 jitter reduction design: `docs/plans/2026-01-19-jitter-reduction-phase2-design.md`
- Added Phase 2 jitter reduction implementation guide: `docs/plans/2026-01-19-jitter-reduction-phase2-impl.md`
- Updated `docs/plans/2026-01-17-Optimisation_Opportunities.md` with expert analysis findings

---

### Jitter Reduction Optimizations (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

The following optimizations reduce audio jitter by eliminating hot-path allocations, reducing blocking operations, and improving thread scheduling.

#### A1: DSD Remainder Ring Buffer

**Problem:** DSD packet remainder handling used `memmove()` for O(n) operations.

**Solution:** Replaced with O(1) ring buffer using power-of-2 masking.

**Files changed:**
- `src/AudioEngine.h`: Added ring buffer arrays and helper methods
- `src/AudioEngine.cpp`: Updated `readSamples()`, `close()`, `seek()` to use ring buffer

**Before:** `memmove()` on every partial packet
**After:** Constant-time push/pop with no data movement

---

#### A2: Pre-allocate Resampler Buffer

**Problem:** Resampler buffer allocated on hot path during `readSamples()`.

**Solution:** Pre-allocate 256KB buffer during `initResampler()`.

**File:** `src/AudioEngine.cpp:1091-1098`

**Impact:** Eliminates malloc/free jitter during playback.

---

#### A3: Async Logging Ring Buffer

**Problem:** `cout` logging in hot paths (`sendAudio`, `getNewStream`) could block.

**Solution:** Lock-free SPSC ring buffer with background drain thread.

**Files changed:**
- `src/DirettaSync.h`: Added `LogRing` class and `DIRETTA_LOG_ASYNC` macro
- `src/main.cpp`: Added `g_logRing` global and drain thread lifecycle
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp`: Replaced hot-path `DIRETTA_LOG` with `DIRETTA_LOG_ASYNC`

**Impact:** Logging no longer blocks audio threads (verbose mode only).

---

#### F1: Worker Thread Priority Elevation

**Problem:** Diretta worker thread ran at normal priority, subject to preemption.

**Solution:** Set SCHED_FIFO priority 50 at thread start (requires root/CAP_SYS_NICE).

**File:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp:31-51` (helper function), line 1419 (call site)

**Impact:** Reduced scheduling jitter for Diretta SDK callbacks.

---

#### G1: Interruptible Format Transition Waits

**Problem:** Format transitions used blocking `sleep_for()` that couldn't be interrupted.

**Solution:** Replaced with condition variable `wait_for()` that wakes on shutdown signal.

**Files changed:**
- `src/DirettaSync.h`: Added `m_transitionCv`, `m_transitionMutex`, `m_transitionWakeup`
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp`: Added `interruptibleWait()` helper, updated `open()` and `reopenForFormatChange()`

**Impact:** Faster shutdown response during format changes (DSD→PCM, rate changes).

---

#### Production Build (NOLOG)

**Problem:** Verbose logging (`-v` flag) still had runtime overhead even when disabled.

**Solution:** Added compile-time `NOLOG` flag that completely removes all logging code.

**Files changed:**
- `Makefile`: Added `-DNOLOG` when `NOLOG=1` is set
- `src/DirettaSync.h`: `DIRETTA_LOG` and `DIRETTA_LOG_ASYNC` compile to nothing
- `src/DirettaRenderer.cpp`, `src/UPnPDevice.cpp`, `src/AudioEngine.cpp`: `DEBUG_LOG` compiles to nothing

**Usage:**
```bash
make NOLOG=1    # Production build - zero logging overhead
```

---

#### Quick Resume Stabilization Fix

**Problem:** Track transitions within the same format caused unnecessary silence ("white") due to post-online stabilization being reset.

**Solution:** Quick resume path no longer resets `m_postOnlineDelayDone` - DAC is already stable from previous track.

**File:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (quick resume path in `open()`)

**Impact:** Same-format track changes now start immediately after prefill (no stabilization silence).

---

#### Reduced PCM Stabilization Time

**Problem:** `POST_ONLINE_SILENCE_BUFFERS` was set to 50 (~50ms), causing noticeable delay on fresh start.

**Solution:** Reduced from 50 to 20 buffers (~20ms for PCM).

**File:** `src/DirettaSync.h:198`

**Impact:** Faster playback start on new albums.

---

### Quick Wins Batch (Low-Effort Optimizations)

#### G4: DSD512 Reset Delay Scaling

**Problem:** DSD→PCM transition delay was fixed at 400ms regardless of DSD rate.

**Solution:** Scale delay with DSD multiplier (200ms × multiplier).

**File:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp:491-492`

**Impact:** DSD64: 200ms, DSD512: 1600ms - proper pipeline flush at high rates.

---

#### C1: DSD Buffer Pre-allocation

**Problem:** DSD channel buffers allocated on first frame (jitter source).

**Solution:** Pre-allocate 32KB per channel at track open.

**File:** `src/AudioEngine.cpp:413-422`

**Impact:** Eliminates first-frame allocation spike for DSD playback.

---

#### D2: swr_get_delay() Caching

**Problem:** FFmpeg resampler delay queried every frame.

**Solution:** Cache delay value, refresh every 100 frames.

**Files:** `src/AudioEngine.h:174-178`, `src/AudioEngine.cpp:901-906`

**Impact:** Reduces per-frame FFmpeg function calls.

---

#### N7: Silence Scaling Consistency

**Problem:** Shutdown silence buffer counts were fixed, not scaled for DSD rate.

**Solution:** Auto-scale silence buffers with DSD multiplier in `requestShutdownSilence()`.

**File:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp:1492-1506`

**Impact:** Consistent pipeline flush timing across all DSD rates.

---

#### PCM Bypass Runtime Format Verification

**Problem:** PCM bypass mode checked codec context format at initialization, but actual decoded frame format could differ at runtime, causing "accelerated garbage" audio at high sample rates (352.8kHz).

**Root Cause:** The `canBypass()` function checked `m_codecContext->sample_fmt`, but `m_frame->format` could differ. If FFmpeg returned planar data when packed was expected, only one channel would be copied, causing "accelerated" playback.

**Solution:**
1. Added runtime verification in bypass path: checks `m_frame->format` matches expectations
2. Added explicit `av_sample_fmt_is_planar()` check in both `canBypass()` and runtime verification
3. If mismatch detected, automatically falls back to resampler path mid-stream
4. Improved diagnostic logging showing actual format details

**Files:** `src/AudioEngine.cpp:884-905` (runtime check), `src/AudioEngine.cpp:1208-1214` (canBypass planar check)

**Impact:** PCM 8fs (352.8kHz/24-bit) files now play correctly; runtime fallback prevents audio corruption.

---

## 2026-01-19 - FFmpeg Version Mismatch Detection

### Problem

Compiling with FFmpeg headers from one version (e.g., 7.x) but linking against libraries from another version (e.g., 5.x) causes segmentation faults at runtime. This is painful to diagnose as the crash occurs deep in FFmpeg code with no obvious cause.

### Solution

The Makefile now:
1. Detects FFmpeg header version (from `libavformat/version_major.h`)
2. Detects runtime library version (via `pkg-config` or `ldconfig`)
3. Displays both versions during build
4. **Errors if versions mismatch** (prevents building broken binaries)

### Build Output

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  FFmpeg Configuration

## 2026-01-18 - Known Issue with SDK 148

**Issue:** Track changes may fail or cause segfault when using SDK 148 (works fine with SDK 147).

**Symptom:** First track plays fine, but on track change (especially with format change like 44.1kHz→48kHz), playback starts briefly then stops, or crashes.

**Current status:** Testing the EXPERIMENTAL: User Interaction Full Reopen feature (Session 4) as a fix. This forces a full SDK reopen sequence via `reopenForFormatChange()` for user-initiated track changes, which includes the `setSink()` retry loop that may be required for SDK 148.

**Workaround:** Use SDK 147, or checkout commit `29ecf0b` for a known-working version:
```bash
git checkout 29ecf0b
```

## 2026-01-18 - PCM Buffer Rounding Drift Fix

**Credit:** leeeanh (commit 0841b2c)

### Problem

For 44.1kHz-family sample rates (44100, 88200, 176400Hz), buffer size calculation caused gradual drift:
- Frames per 1ms = 44.1 (fractional)
- Old code rounded up: `(rate + 999) / 1000` = 45 frames
- Each buffer was 0.9 frames too large
- Consumer gradually requested more data than producer provided
- Result: underruns like `avail=8 need=360`

### Solution

Bresenham-style accumulator tracks fractional frames:
```
44100Hz → base=44, remainder=100
Every getNewStream():
  accumulator += remainder
  if (accumulator >= 1000):
    accumulator -= 1000
    add 1 extra frame
```

Over 10 buffers: 9×44 + 1×45 = 441 frames = exactly 44.1 avg

### C1 Integration

Integrated into C1 generation counter caching to minimize hot path overhead:
- `bytesPerFrame` and `framesPerBufferRemainder` cached on format change
- Only the accumulator (per-call state) uses atomic operations

**Files changed:**
- `src/DirettaSync.h` - Added `m_bytesPerFrame`, `m_framesPerBufferRemainder`, `m_framesPerBufferAccumulator` atomics; cached consumer state members
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp` - Accumulator logic in `getNewStream()`, initialization in `configureRingPCM/DSD()` and `fullReset()`

---

## 2026-01-18 - Consumer Hot Path Optimization

Based on leeeanh's analysis. Implements C1 and C2 optimizations from his design document.

### C1: Consumer Generation Counter

Added generation counter for `getNewStream()` hot path, mirroring the producer-side optimization already in `sendAudio()`.

**Before:** 4 atomic loads on every `getNewStream()` call
**After:** 1 atomic load (generation check) in common case (~99.9%)

**Cached stable state:**
- `m_bytesPerBuffer`
- `silenceByte`
- `m_isDsdMode`
- `m_sampleRate`

**Still checked fresh (volatile):**
- `m_silenceBuffersRemaining`
- `m_stopRequested`
- `m_prefillComplete`
- `m_postOnlineDelayDone`

### C2: RingAccessGuard Memory Ordering

Refined memory orderings for more precise semantics:
- `fetch_add`: `acq_rel` → `acquire` (ensures increment visible before ring ops)
- `fetch_sub` (destructor): `acq_rel` → `release` (ensures ring ops complete before decrement)
- `fetch_sub` (bail-out): `acq_rel` → `relaxed` (never entered guarded section)

**Files changed:**
- `src/DirettaSync.h` - Added `m_consumerStateGen` and cached consumer state members
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp` - Generation counter in `getNewStream()`, refined `RingAccessGuard` ordering

**Credit:** leeeanh for the analysis and design

---

## 2026-01-18 - EXPERIMENTAL: User Interaction Full Reopen

### Experimental Feature

**Purpose:** Test a more conservative track transition approach.

**Previous behavior:**
- Quick path: Same format (regardless of how track change occurred)
- Full reopen: Format change detected

**New behavior (EXPERIMENTAL):**
- Quick path: ONLY for sequential/gapless playback (SetNextAVTransportURI → natural track end)
- Full reopen: ANY user interaction (SetAVTransportURI while playing) OR format change

**Rationale:** User-initiated track changes are natural "break points" where a clean reset is acceptable. Gapless sequential playback should remain fast when formats match.

**Files changed:**
- `src/DirettaSync.h` - Added `setForceFullReopen()` method and `m_forceFullReopen` flag
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp` - Check flag in `open()`, trigger `reopenForFormatChange()` if set
- `src/DirettaRenderer.cpp` - Set flag in `onSetURI` callback before stopping playback

**To revert:** Search for "EXPERIMENTAL:" comments and remove the related code blocks.

---

## 2026-01-17 - Format Change Gapless Fix

### Bug Fix

**Fixed:** Track changes with format/sample rate changes now auto-resume correctly.

**Root cause:** During gapless playback with format changes (e.g., DSD→PCM, 44.1kHz→96kHz), the `trackEndCallback` was incorrectly being called. This callback is designed for **playlist end** and calls `m_direttaSync->release()`, which fully disconnects from the Diretta target and sets transport state to STOPPED.

**Symptom:** After a track ended and the next track had a different format, playback would stop and require manual Play command to continue.

**Fix:** Removed the `trackEndCallback()` call from the format change transition path in `AudioEngine::process()`. The format change path now correctly keeps the Diretta connection alive and lets `DirettaSync::open()` handle the format transition.

**File changed:** `src/AudioEngine.cpp` (lines 1554-1557)

---

## 2026-01-17 (Session 2) - Timing Variance Optimization

Systematic optimization pass focused on reducing timing variance in the audio hot path. Based on the principle that consistent timing matters more than average-case speed for audio quality.

**Full technical details:** [docs/Timing_Variance_Optimization_Report.md](docs/Timing_Variance_Optimization_Report.md)

### Phase 1: Quick Wins

| ID | Change | Impact |
|----|--------|--------|
| **N3** | Consolidated bit reversal LUT | Single 256-byte table shared between AudioEngine and DirettaRingBuffer |
| **S4** | Retry constants namespace | `DirettaRetry::` constants replace magic numbers |
| **S5** | DSD diagnostics compile flag | Build with `make DSD_DIAG=1` when needed |

### Phase 2: Moderate Effort

| ID | Change | Impact |
|----|--------|--------|
| **R1+R2** | Format generation counter | 1 atomic load vs 5-6 per sendAudio() call (~200-300ns saved) |

### Phase 3: Significant Effort

| ID | Change | Impact |
|----|--------|--------|
| **N1** | Direct write API | Zero-copy fast path for contiguous ring buffer regions |
| **N4** | SIMD memcpy assessment | Current AVX2 implementation deemed optimal |

### New APIs

**DirettaRingBuffer:**
- `getDirectWriteRegion(size_t needed, uint8_t*& region, size_t& available)` - Get direct write pointer
- `commitDirectWrite(size_t written)` - Commit direct write
- `getStagingForConversion(int type)` - Get staging buffer by type
- `getStagingBufferSize()` - Staging buffer size constant

**DirettaRetry namespace:**
- `OPEN_RETRIES`, `OPEN_DELAY_MS` - Connection establishment
- `SETSINK_RETRIES_FULL/QUICK`, `SETSINK_DELAY_FULL/QUICK_MS` - Sink configuration
- `CONNECT_RETRIES`, `CONNECT_DELAY_MS` - Connect sequence
- `REOPEN_SINK_RETRIES`, `REOPEN_SINK_DELAY_MS` - Format change reopen

### Build Options

```bash
make              # Normal build
make DSD_DIAG=1   # Enable DSD diagnostic output
```

### Files Modified

- `src/AudioEngine.cpp` - LUT consolidation, DSD diagnostics conditional
- `src/DirettaSync.h` - Retry namespace, generation counter, cached format values
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp` - Use retry constants, generation counter pattern
- `src/DirettaRingBuffer.h` - Direct write API, optimized push()
- `Makefile` - DSD_DIAG option

---

## 2026-01-17 - Hot Path Simplification

Systematic code simplification focused on reducing timing variance in the audio callback hot path. The goal is improved audio quality through more predictable code execution.

**Full technical details:** [docs/Hot Path Simplification Report.md](docs/Hot%20Path%20Simplification%20Report.md)

### Critical Changes (Hot Path)

| ID | Change | Impact |
|----|--------|--------|

## 2026-01-15 (Session 3) - TEST BUILD

### Format Transition Noise Investigation

**Purpose:** Test build to diagnose switching noise during format transitions. Pre-transition silence buffers were suspected of contributing to the noise rather than preventing it.

**Changes:**

| Setting | Original | Test Value |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Pre-transition silence | Enabled (100-1000 buffers) | **Disabled** |
| DSD→PCM delay | 800ms | **400ms** |
| DSD rate change delay | 400ms | 400ms (unchanged) |
| PCM rate change delay | 200ms | **100ms** |

**Files modified:**
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp`:
  - `sendPreTransitionSilence()` (line 1140-1142) - Early return added
  - `reopenForFormatChange()` (line 730-758) - Silence wrapped in `#if 0`
  - DSD→PCM delay (line 459) - Reduced from 800 to 400
  - PCM rate change delay (line 506) - Reduced from 200 to 100

**To revert:**
1. Remove early `return` in `sendPreTransitionSilence()`
2. Change `#if 0` to `#if 1` in `reopenForFormatChange()`
3. Restore delay values: DSD→PCM=800, PCM rate=200

### PCM FIFO and Bypass Optimization (thanks to @leeeanh)

Four interconnected optimizations to the PCM audio path, adapted from the leeeanh fork optimization designs with preservation of existing bug fixes.

#### 1. Enhanced S24 Detection

**Problem:** Original S24 detection failed when 24-bit tracks start with silence.

**Solution:** Hybrid detection with three layers:

- Sample-based detection (checks both LSB and MSB byte positions)
- Hint from FFmpeg metadata (fallback for silence)
- Timeout mechanism (~1 second defaults to LSB)

**Files:**

- `src/DirettaRingBuffer.h` - Added `S24PackMode::Deferred`, hint mechanism, timeout
- `src/DirettaSync.h` - Added `setS24PackModeHint()` method

#### 2. AVAudioFifo for PCM Overflow

**Problem:** Original overflow handling used `memmove()` with O(n) complexity.

**Solution:** Replaced with FFmpeg's `AVAudioFifo`:

- O(1) circular buffer operations
- Dynamic sizing based on sample rate (8192 @ 48kHz → 64k+ @ high rates)
- Separate DSD remainder buffer (`m_dsdPacketRemainder`) from PCM FIFO

| Sample Rate | FIFO Size      |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 48 kHz      | 8,192 samples  |
| 96 kHz      | 16,384 samples |
| 192 kHz     | 32,768 samples |
| 384 kHz     | 65,536 samples |

**Files:**

- `src/AudioEngine.h` - Added `AVAudioFifo* m_pcmFifo`, separated DSD buffer
- `src/AudioEngine.cpp` - FIFO allocation in `initResampler()`, usage in `readSamples()`

#### 3. PCM Bypass Mode

**Problem:** Audio processed through SwrContext even when formats match exactly.

**Solution:** Bypass mode that skips SwrContext for bit-perfect playback when:

- Sample rates match exactly
- Channel counts match
- Format is packed integer (S16 or S32) - NOT planar, NOT float
- Bit depth matches

**Files:**

- `src/AudioEngine.h` - Added `m_bypassMode`, `canBypass()` method
- `src/AudioEngine.cpp` - Bypass check in `initResampler()`, explicit bypass path in `readSamples()`

**Expected log output:** `[AudioDecoder] PCM BYPASS enabled - bit-perfect path`

#### 4. S24 Hint Propagation

**Problem:** S24 alignment hint from FFmpeg wasn't reaching the ring buffer.

**Solution:** Propagation path: `TrackInfo` → `DirettaRenderer` → `DirettaSync` → `DirettaRingBuffer`

**Files:**

- `src/AudioEngine.h` - Added `TrackInfo::S24Alignment` enum
- `src/AudioEngine.cpp` - Detection based on codec ID (PCM_S24, FLAC, ALAC)
- `src/DirettaRenderer.cpp` - Propagation to `m_direttaSync->setS24PackModeHint()`

**Documentation:**

- Summary: [`docs/PCM_FIFO_BYPASS_OPTIMIZATION.md`](docs/PCM_FIFO_BYPASS_OPTIMIZATION.md)
- Design: [`docs/plans/2026-01-15-pcm-bypass-optimization-design.md`](docs/plans/2026-01-15-pcm-bypass-optimization-design.md)

**Preserved bug fixes:** FFmpeg ABI compatibility, ARM64 compilation, DSD transition silence, DSD per-channel buffers, DSD512 Zen3 warmup.

### DSD Conversion Function Specialization

**Problem:** Per-iteration branch checks inside the DSD conversion hot loop for operations that are constant per-track. At DSD512 (22.5 MHz), this added ~176,000 unnecessary branch predictions per second.

**Root cause:** `convertDSDPlanar_AVX2()` checked `if (bitReversalTable)` and `if (needByteSwap)` on every 32-byte chunk, even though these values never change during playback.

**Solution:** Pre-select specialized conversion function at track open time:

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `Passthrough` | Just interleave (fastest) | DSF→LSB target, DFF→MSB target |
| `BitReverseOnly` | Apply bit reversal | DSF→MSB target, DFF→LSB target |
| `ByteSwapOnly` | Endianness conversion | Little-endian targets |
| `BitReverseAndSwap` | Both operations | Little-endian + bit order mismatch |

**Implementation:**
- Added `DSDConversionMode` enum to `DirettaRingBuffer.h`
- Created 4 specialized conversion functions (each ~350 lines with AVX2 + scalar fallback):
  - `convertDSD_Passthrough()` - Zero transformation overhead
  - `convertDSD_BitReverse()` - Embedded LUT, no null check
  - `convertDSD_ByteSwap()` - Byte reordering only
  - `convertDSD_BitReverseSwap()` - Combined operations
- Added `pushDSDPlanarOptimized()` with switch-case dispatch
- `configureSinkDSD()` now sets `m_dsdConversionMode` based on source format + sink requirements
- `sendAudio()` uses optimized path with cached mode

**Files:**
- `src/DirettaRingBuffer.h` (lines 104-110, 326-364, 557-896)
- `src/DirettaSync.h` (line 389) - Added `m_dsdConversionMode` member
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (lines 904-975, 1215-1217) - Mode selection and usage

**Documentation:**
- Summary: [`docs/DSD_CONVERSION_OPTIMIZATION.md`](docs/DSD_CONVERSION_OPTIMIZATION.md)
- Design: [`docs/plans/2026-01-15-dsd-conversion-optimization-design.md`](docs/plans/2026-01-15-dsd-conversion-optimization-design.md)

### PCM Sample Rate Transition Noise Fix

**Problem:** Transition noise when changing sample rates in PCM (e.g., 44.1kHz → 96kHz).

**Root cause:** PCM rate changes used `reopenForFormatChange()` which tries to send silence buffers, but playback is already stopped when the new track arrives, so silence never gets sent. Target's internal buffers still contain old samples at the previous rate.

**Solution:** PCM rate changes now use the same full close/reopen approach as DSD transitions:

| Transition | Action | Delay |
|------------|--------|-------|
| PCM rate change | Full close/reopen | 200ms |
| DSD→PCM | Full close/reopen | 800ms |
| DSD rate change | Full close/reopen | 400ms |
| PCM→DSD | reopenForFormatChange() | 800ms |

**Files:**
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (lines 476-522) - Added `isPcmRateChange` detection and full close/reopen path

---

### FLAC Bypass Bug Fix

**Problem:** FLAC files played at twice the normal speed.

**Root cause:** `canBypass()` returned `true` for FLAC because the codec context sample format check passed. However, FLAC always decodes to planar format (`FLTP`/`S32P`), which requires conversion through SwrContext.

**Solution:** Added explicit check for compressed formats at the start of `canBypass()`:

```cpp
if (m_trackInfo.isCompressed) {
    DEBUG_LOG("[AudioDecoder] canBypass: NO (compressed format requires decoding)");
    return false;
}
```

**Files:**
- `src/AudioEngine.cpp` (lines 295-299) - Added `isCompressed` check in `canBypass()`

---

## 2026-01-15

### FFmpeg ABI Compatibility Fix

**Problem:** Segmentation fault when running against FFmpeg 5.x libraries after compiling on a system with FFmpeg 7.x development headers. Crash occurred in `AudioDecoder::open()` when accessing `AVStream->codecpar`.

**Root cause:**
- Compile-time FFmpeg headers (libavformat 61.x from FFmpeg 7.x) have different `AVStream` structure layout than runtime libraries (libavformat 59.x from FFmpeg 5.x)
- The `codecpar` field offset differs between versions, causing garbage pointer dereference
- Debug output showed: `codecpar=0x5622000000001` (garbage) instead of valid pointer

**Solution - Multi-layered approach:**

1. **AudioEngine.cpp** - Safer stream detection:
   - Replaced manual stream iteration loop with `av_find_best_stream()` (FFmpeg's recommended API)
   - Added NULL checks for `audioStream` and `audioStream->codecpar` after retrieval
   - Handles edge cases in FFmpeg 5.x where codecpar may be invalid

2. **install.sh** - Automatic header management:
   - Added `download_ffmpeg_headers()` - downloads FFmpeg source for headers only
   - Added `check_ffmpeg_abi_compatibility()` - detects runtime vs compile-time version mismatch
   - Added `ensure_ffmpeg_headers()` - auto-downloads correct headers when needed
   - Added `detect_ffmpeg_runtime_version()` and `get_ffmpeg_target_version()` for auto-detection
   - `build_renderer()` now automatically uses `make FFMPEG_PATH=./ffmpeg-headers`
   - FFmpeg installation now offers both **5.1.2** and **7.1** (recommended) build options
   - Selected version saved to `.ffmpeg-version` for future builds
   - New config variables: `FFMPEG_HEADERS_DIR`, `FFMPEG_TARGET_VERSION`

3. **Makefile** - Auto-detection and warnings:
   - Auto-detects `./ffmpeg-headers/` directory (created by install.sh)
   - Shows clear warning box when using system headers
   - Supports explicit override: `make FFMPEG_PATH=/path/to/headers`

4. **New .gitignore** - Excludes downloaded headers from version control

**Usage:**
```bash
# Option A: Use install.sh (recommended - auto-downloads headers)
./install.sh --build

# Option B: Manual download
wget https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-5.1.2.tar.xz
tar xf ffmpeg-5.1.2.tar.xz
mv ffmpeg-5.1.2 ffmpeg-headers
make clean && make

# Option C: Explicit path
make clean && make FFMPEG_PATH=/path/to/ffmpeg-5.1.2
```

**Files:**
- `src/AudioEngine.cpp` (lines 139-171) - Stream detection rewrite
- `install.sh` (lines 512-656) - Header download functions
- `install.sh` (lines 721-734) - Build with correct headers
- `Makefile` (lines 181-229) - FFmpeg path auto-detection
- `.gitignore` - New file

---

### ARM64 Compilation Fix

**Problem:** Build failed on ARM64 (aarch64) with `fatal error: immintrin.h: No such file or directory`. The `immintrin.h` header is x86-only (AVX/SSE intrinsics) and doesn't exist on ARM64 systems.

**Solution:** Added architecture detection and conditional compilation throughout `DirettaRingBuffer.h`:

1. **Architecture detection macro:**
   ```cpp
   #if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(_M_X64) || defined(__i386__) || defined(_M_IX86)
       #define DIRETTA_HAS_AVX2 1
       #include <immintrin.h>
   #else
       #define DIRETTA_HAS_AVX2 0
   #endif
   ```

2. **Conditional AVX2 functions:**
   - `convert24BitPacked_AVX2()` - x86 AVX2 with scalar fallback
   - `convert24BitPackedShifted_AVX2()` - x86 AVX2 with scalar fallback
   - `convert16To32_AVX2()` - x86 AVX2 with scalar fallback
   - `convertDSDPlanar_AVX2()` - x86 AVX2 with scalar fallback (uses `convertDSDPlanar_Scalar()`)
   - `simd_bit_reverse()` - x86-only helper (guarded)

3. **Scalar fallbacks for ARM64:**
   - Pure C++ implementations for all conversion functions
   - Uses existing `convertDSDPlanar_Scalar()` for DSD processing
   - `memcpyfast_audio.h` already had ARM64 support (uses `std::memcpy`)

**Performance note:** ARM64 builds use scalar code paths which are still efficient due to:
- GCC/Clang NEON auto-vectorization for simple loops
- Standard library optimizations in `std::memcpy`

**Files:**
- `src/DirettaRingBuffer.h` - Architecture guards and scalar fallbacks

### Pre-Transition Silence for DSD Format Changes

**Problem:** Crackling noise when switching DSD rates or transitioning DSD→PCM, despite previous fixes (full close/reopen with delays). The issue reappeared after Zen3 stabilization buffer changes.

**Root cause analysis:**
- When `onSetURI` receives a new track, it calls `stopPlayback(true)` (immediate)
- With `immediate=true`, NO silence buffers are sent before stopping
- The Diretta target's internal buffers still contain old DSD audio
- Comment in code acknowledged this: "We can't send silence here because playback is already stopped"
- The Zen3 stabilization change (longer post-online warmup) gave more time for residual audio artifacts to manifest

**Solution:** Added `sendPreTransitionSilence()` method that sends rate-scaled silence BEFORE calling `stopPlayback()`:

| DSD Rate | Silence Buffers | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| DSD64    | 100             | Base level |
| DSD128   | 200             | 2× data rate |
| DSD256   | 400             | 4× data rate |
| DSD512   | 800             | 8× data rate |
| PCM      | 30              | Lower throughput |

**Implementation:**
- New public method `DirettaSync::sendPreTransitionSilence()`
- Calculates silence buffers based on current DSD rate: `100 × (sampleRate / 2822400)`
- Waits for silence to be consumed by `getNewStream()` (timeout scales with buffer count)
- Called in two locations:
  1. `onSetURI` callback before `stopPlayback()` (normal track change)
  2. Audio callback format change detection (gapless transitions)

**Transition flow after fix:**
```
1. onSetURI receives new track
2. m_audioEngine->stop()
3. waitForCallbackComplete()
4. sendPreTransitionSilence()  ← NEW: Flushes Diretta pipeline
5. stopPlayback(true)
6. [New format open() proceeds with clean target state]
```

**Files:**
- `src/DirettaSync.h` (lines 244-251) - Method declaration
- `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (lines 1058-1103) - Implementation
- `src/DirettaRenderer.cpp` (lines 366-368, 226-228) - Call sites

**Status:** Significantly improved. If crackling persists in edge cases, consider:
- Increasing silence buffer multiplier
- Adjusting timeout scaling
- Adding post-silence delay before `stopPlayback()`



---

## 2026-01-14

### 1. DSD Buffer Optimization - Pre-allocated Buffers

- Eliminated per-call heap allocations in DSD hot path
- Replaced `std::vector<uint8_t>` with pre-allocated `AudioBuffer` members
- Added `m_dsdLeftBuffer`, `m_dsdRightBuffer`, `m_dsdBufferCapacity` to `AudioDecoder`
- All `.insert()` operations replaced with `memcpy()` + offset tracking
- Buffers only resize when capacity is insufficient (rare, typically once per session)
- **Files:** `src/AudioEngine.h` (lines 141-144), `src/AudioEngine.cpp` (lines 552-661, 534)

### 2. DSD Rate-Adaptive Chunk Sizing

- Added `DirettaBuffer::calculateDsdSamplesPerCall()` function
- DSD chunks now scale with sample rate to maintain ~12ms granularity
- Previously fixed at 32768 samples regardless of DSD rate
- Significantly reduces loop iterations for high-rate DSD (DSD256+)
- **Files:** `src/DirettaSync.h` (lines 109-132), `src/DirettaRenderer.cpp` (lines 567-575)

### Performance Impact

| DSD Rate | Before (fixed 32768) | After (rate-adaptive) | Improvement |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| DSD64    | ~11.6ms/chunk        | ~12.1ms/chunk         | Similar |
| DSD128   | ~5.8ms/chunk         | ~12.0ms/chunk         | 2x fewer iterations |
| DSD256   | ~2.9ms/chunk         | ~11.6ms/chunk         | 4x fewer iterations |
| DSD512   | ~1.45ms/chunk        | ~5.8ms/chunk          | 4x fewer iterations |
| DSD1024  | ~0.7ms/chunk         | ~2.9ms/chunk          | 4x fewer iterations |

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Heap allocations per DSD read | 2 (std::vector) | 0 (steady state) |
| Memory pattern | Alloc/free every call | Pre-allocated, reused |

### 3. DSD512 Startup Fix for Zen3 CPUs (MTU-Aware)

- Scaled post-online stabilization to achieve consistent **warmup TIME** regardless of MTU
- Fixes harsh sound at DSD512 startup on AMD Zen3 systems (works fine on Zen4)
- Root cause: Zen3's slower memory controller and different cache hierarchy need more warmup time at high data throughput
- Additional issue: With small MTU (1500), `getNewStream()` is called more frequently (shorter cycle time), so a fixed buffer count resulted in insufficient warmup time

**Target warmup time by DSD rate:**

| DSD Rate | Target Warmup |
|----------|---------------|
| DSD64    | 50ms          |
| DSD128   | 100ms         |
| DSD256   | 200ms         |
| DSD512   | 400ms         |

**Buffer count scales with MTU to achieve target time:**

| MTU | Cycle Time (DSD512) | Buffers for 400ms |
|-----|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1500 | 261 μs | ~1530 buffers |
| 9000 | 1,590 μs | ~252 buffers |
| 16128 | 2,853 μs | ~140 buffers |

**Formula:**
```
targetWarmupMs = 50ms × dsdMultiplier
cycleTimeUs = (MTU - 24) / bytesPerSecond × 1,000,000
buffersNeeded = targetWarmupMs × 1000 / cycleTimeUs
```

- **Files:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (lines 1201-1239)

### 4. DSD Rate Change Transition Noise Fix

- **All DSD rate changes** now use full close/reopen (not just downgrades)
- Includes clock domain changes: DSD512×44.1kHz ↔ DSD512×48kHz
- Previously used `reopenForFormatChange()` which tries to send silence buffers
- Problem: When user selects new track, playback stops before transition, so `getNewStream()` isn't called and silence buffers never get sent to target
- Target's internal buffers still contain old DSD data → causes noise on new format
- Solution: Same aggressive approach as DSD→PCM (full `DIRETTA::Sync::close()` + delay + fresh `open()`)

| Transition | Action | Delay |
|------------|--------|-------|
| DSD→PCM | Full close/reopen | 800ms |
| DSD→DSD (any rate change) | Full close/reopen | 400ms |
| PCM→DSD | reopenForFormatChange() | 800ms |
| PCM→PCM (rate change) | reopenForFormatChange() | 800ms |

- **Files:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (lines 401-482)

### 5. Install Script Restructuring

Complete rewrite of `install.sh` with modular architecture and improved FFmpeg handling.

**Structural improvements:**
- Modular function-based architecture with clear section headers
- CLI argument support: `--full`, `--deps`, `--build`, `--configure`, `--optimize`, `--help`
- Interactive menu system with numbered options
- `confirm()` helper for consistent yes/no prompts

**FFmpeg changes:**
- Removed FFmpeg 5.1.2 and 6.1.1 (both have DSD segfault issues with GCC 14+)
- FFmpeg 7.1 is now the only source build option
- Build flags: `--enable-lto` for link-time optimization
- Added `mjpeg` and `png` decoders for embedded album art in DSF/DFF files
- Options: Build from source (recommended), RPM Fusion (Fedora), System packages

**Network buffer optimization:**
- Added sysctl settings for high-resolution audio streaming:
  - `net.core.rmem_max=16777216` (16MB receive buffer)
  - `net.core.wmem_max=16777216` (16MB send buffer)
- Available in both normal network config and aggressive optimization
- Persistent via `/etc/sysctl.d/99-diretta.conf`

**Fedora aggressive optimization (option 5):**
- Integrated from `optimize_fedora_server.sh`
- Removes: firewalld, SELinux, polkit, gssproxy
- Disables: journald, oomd, homed, auditd
- Replaces sshd with dropbear (lightweight SSH)
- Double confirmation required (safety)
- Intended for dedicated audio servers only

- **Files:** `install.sh`

### 6. CPU Isolation and Thread Distribution Tuner Scripts

Added two tuner scripts for CPU core isolation and real-time scheduling optimization.

**Common features (both scripts):**
- CPU isolation via kernel parameters (`isolcpus`, `nohz_full`, `rcu_nocbs`)
- Systemd slice for CPU pinning
- Real-time FIFO scheduling (priority 90)
- IRQ affinity to housekeeping cores
- CPU governor set to performance
- Automatic thread distribution across cores (via `ExecStartPost`)
- Manual `redistribute` command for testing without service restart

**Option 1: `diretta-renderer-tuner.sh` (SMT enabled)**

For systems where SMT (Hyper-Threading) is acceptable:
- Housekeeping: cores 0,8 (1 physical core + SMT sibling)
- Renderer: cores 1-7,9-15 (14 logical CPUs)
- 11 threads distributed across 14 CPUs (~1 thread per CPU)

**Option 2: `diretta-renderer-tuner-nosmt.sh` (SMT disabled)**

For dedicated audio servers with low system load:
- Adds `nosmt` kernel parameter to disable Hyper-Threading
- Housekeeping: core 0 (1 physical core)
- Renderer: cores 1-7 (7 physical cores)
- 11 threads distributed across 7 cores (~1.5 threads per core)

**Recommendation:**
- For dedicated low-load audio servers: **no-SMT** provides more predictable latency
- For multi-purpose systems: **SMT** provides more parallelism

**Usage:**
```bash
# Apply configuration (requires reboot for kernel params)
sudo ./diretta-renderer-tuner.sh apply

# Test thread distribution immediately (no reboot)
sudo ./diretta-renderer-tuner.sh redistribute

# Check current status and thread layout
sudo ./diretta-renderer-tuner.sh status

# Revert all changes
sudo ./diretta-renderer-tuner.sh revert
```

- **Files:** `diretta-renderer-tuner.sh`, `diretta-renderer-tuner-nosmt.sh`

### 4. Install Script Enhancements

- Updated with working FFmpeg 7.1 build configuration
- Added FFmpeg installation test suite:
  - Checks required decoders (FLAC, ALAC, DSD, PCM)
  - Checks required demuxers (FLAC, WAV, DSF, MOV)
  - Checks required protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FILE)
  - Runs decode functionality test
- Fixed directory handling after FFmpeg build
- Installs to `/usr/local` (coexists with system FFmpeg)
- **Files:** `install.sh`

### 5. DSD→PCM Transition Fix for I2S Targets

- Added special handling in `DirettaSync::open()` for DSD→PCM format transitions
- I2S/LVDS targets are more timing-sensitive than USB and need cleaner transitions
- DSD→PCM now performs: full `DIRETTA::Sync::close()` + 800ms delay + fresh `open()`
- Other format transitions (PCM→DSD, PCM→PCM, DSD→DSD) unchanged
- **Files:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (lines 372-421)

### 6. UPnP Stop Signal Handling

- Diretta connection now properly closed when UPnP Stop action received
- Ensures clean handoff when switching renderers
- Pause action unchanged (keeps connection open)
- **Files:** `src/DirettaRenderer.cpp` (lines 419-431)

### 7. Enhanced Target Listing

- `--list-targets` now shows detailed target information:
  - Output name (e.g., "LVDS", "USB") - differentiates ports
  - Port numbers (IN/OUT) and multiport flag
  - SDK version
  - Product ID
- **Files:** `src/DirettaSync.cpp` (lines 269-325)

### 1. Power-of-2 Bitmask Modulo

- Added `roundUpPow2()` helper function (lines 33-44)
- Added `mask_` member variable (line 295)
- `resize()` now rounds up to power-of-2 and sets `mask_ = size_ - 1`
- Replaced all `% size_` with `& mask_` throughout:
  - `getAvailable()` - line 69
  - `getFreeSpace()` - line 73 (simplified)
  - `push()` - line 106
  - `push24BitPacked()` - lines 138, 141-142, 145
  - `push16To32()` - lines 168, 172-174, 177
  - `pushDSDPlanar()` - lines 214, 232-234, 237-239, 244
  - `pop()` - line 268

### 2. Cache-Line Separation

- Added `alignas(64)` to `writePos_` (line 298)
- Added `alignas(64)` to `readPos_` (line 299)

### Performance Impact

| Operation     | Before                              | After                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Modulo        | `% size_` (10-20 cycles)            | `& mask_` (1 cycle)             |
| False sharing | Possible between writePos_/readPos_ | Eliminated (64-byte separation) |

### Note

The buffer size will now be rounded up to the next power of 2. For example:
- Request 3MB → allocate 4MB
- Request 1.5MB → allocate 2MB

This wastes some memory but the tradeoff is worth it for the consistent fast-path performance.

### DirettaSync.h

- Removed `m_pushMutex`
- Added `m_reconfiguring` and `m_ringUsers` atomics for lock-free access
- Converted 11 format parameters to `std::atomic<>` (`m_sampleRate`, `m_channels`, `m_bytesPerSample`, etc.)
- Added `ReconfigureGuard` RAII class
- Added `beginReconfigure()` / `endReconfigure()` method declarations

### DirettaSync.cpp

- Added `RingAccessGuard` class for lock-free ring buffer access
- Added `beginReconfigure()` / `endReconfigure()` implementations
- Updated `sendAudio()` to use `RingAccessGuard` instead of mutex (lock-free hot path)
- Updated `configureRingPCM()`, `configureRingDSD()`, `fullReset()` to use `ReconfigureGuard`
- Updated all format parameter accesses to use atomic load/store with proper memory ordering

### DirettaRingBuffer.h

- Added `S24PackMode` enum (`Unknown`, `LsbAligned`, `MsbAligned`)
- Added `detectS24PackMode()` method that checks first 32 samples
- Updated `push24BitPacked()` to auto-detect and handle both S24 formats
- S24 detection resets on `clear()` and `resize()`

## Key Benefits

1. **Lock-free audio path** - `sendAudio()` no longer takes any mutex
2. **Safe reconfiguration** - `ReconfigureGuard` waits for active readers to drain
3. **S24 format flexibility** - Handles both LSB-aligned (FFmpeg S24_LE) and MSB-aligned formats automatically
